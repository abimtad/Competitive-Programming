# Have a look at this code:
	from collections import Counter
	class Solution(object):
        def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        cs=Counter(nums)
        for key in cs.keys():
            if cs[key]==1:
                return key
        return -1
